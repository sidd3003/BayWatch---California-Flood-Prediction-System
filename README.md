# BayWatch---California-Flood-Prediction-System

Our project addresses the increasing frequency and severity of flooding events in California due to climate change. Despite this, flood insurance policies have decreased, leading to substantial financial losses during flood incidents.

We leverage climate and flooding data from NOAA, along with insurance policy data from FEMA, to build a comprehensive data warehouse. This allows for efficient analytics and data-driven insights to inform flood-related policy-making.

Utilizing Spark with Python on Google Colaboratory VMs for data exploration and Tableau for visual dashboards, we provide compelling insights. AWS technologies like S3, GLUE, and Redshift facilitate data storage, ETL operations, and data warehousing.

Additionally, we develop a web portal with Single-Sign-On functionality using Google Firebase, enabling authorized users to access Redshift data tables and Tableau dashboards.

Overall, our big data platform offers a holistic analytics solution for addressing flood challenges in California, demonstrating the power of data-driven insights for effective policy-making and risk mitigation strategies.

This is a project I have co-created and contributed to in a group of 5 for the DATA 228 Big Data Technologies and Applications course taken during my MS in Data Analytics at San Jose State University.
